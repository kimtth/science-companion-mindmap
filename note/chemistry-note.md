# General Chemistry Overview

## 🎯 Purpose
This mindmap provides a comprehensive overview of college-level chemistry, covering atomic structure, chemical bonding, reactions, and the behavior of matter. It serves as a visual guide to understanding the relationships between chemical concepts and their practical applications.

## 📚 Main Topics

### 1. Atomic Structure
The foundation of chemistry - understanding atoms through quantum mechanics. Modern atomic theory is based on wave mechanics:
- **Subatomic Particles**: Protons, neutrons, electrons
  - Protons define element identity (atomic number Z)
  - Isotopes have same Z but different neutron number
  - Electrons determine chemical behavior
  - Quarks compose protons and neutrons (not directly relevant to chemistry)
- **Electron Configuration**: Arrangement determining chemical behavior
  - Quantum numbers: n (shell), ℓ (subshell), m_ℓ (orbital), m_s (spin)
  - Orbitals are probability distributions, not paths
  - Aufbau principle: fill lowest energy first
  - Hund's rule: maximize unpaired spins in degenerate orbitals
  - Pauli exclusion: max 2 electrons per orbital
  - Shielding and effective nuclear charge Z_eff
- **Periodic Table**: Organization revealing patterns and properties
  - Groups (vertical): similar valence electron configuration
  - Periods (horizontal): same number of electron shells
  - Blocks: s, p, d, f based on highest energy subshell
  - Metals, nonmetals, metalloids
  - Representative (main group) vs transition elements
- **Periodic Trends**: Atomic radius, ionization energy, electronegativity
  - Atomic radius: decreases across (higher Z_eff), increases down (more shells)
  - Ionization energy: increases across, decreases down
  - Electron affinity: generally more negative across period
  - Electronegativity (Pauling scale): F most electronegative (4.0)
  - Metallic character: increases down and left

**Conceptual Insights**:
- Quantum mechanics required to explain atomic stability (classical physics predicts collapse)
- Electron configuration explains all of chemistry
- Periodic table is visual representation of quantum mechanics
- Valence electrons determine bonding behavior
- Core electrons shield valence from nucleus

**Key Applications**: Materials science, spectroscopy, understanding chemical reactivity, predicting compound properties

### 2. Chemical Bonding
Forces holding matter together - from quantum mechanical overlap of orbitals. Bonding is fundamentally about electrons:
- **Ionic Bonding**: Electron transfer forming salts
  - Complete transfer from metal to nonmetal
  - Electrostatic attraction between ions
  - Lattice energy: energy to separate 1 mole of solid into gaseous ions
  - Lattice energy ∝ (charge product)/(ion distance)
  - Born-Haber cycle: thermodynamic analysis
  - Coordination number in ionic crystals
- **Covalent Bonding**: Electron sharing in molecules
  - Valence bond theory: orbital overlap
  - Molecular orbital theory: linear combination of atomic orbitals (LCAO)
  - Bonding MO (lower energy) vs antibonding MO (higher energy)
  - Bond order = (bonding e⁻ - antibonding e⁻)/2
  - Sigma (σ) bonds: end-on overlap (single bonds)
  - Pi (π) bonds: side-to-side overlap (double/triple bonds)
  - Resonance: electron delocalization, molecule is hybrid
  - Formal charge minimization for best Lewis structure
  - Octet rule (and exceptions: expanded octets for period 3+)
- **Hybridization**: Mixing atomic orbitals to explain geometry
  - sp: linear (180°), 2 regions, e.g., BeCl₂, CO₂
  - sp²: trigonal planar (120°), 3 regions, e.g., BF₃, C₂H₄
  - sp³: tetrahedral (109.5°), 4 regions, e.g., CH₄, NH₃, H₂O
  - sp³d: trigonal bipyramidal (90°, 120°), 5 regions
  - sp³d²: octahedral (90°), 6 regions
  - Lone pairs repel more than bonding pairs (affects angles)
- **Molecular Geometry (VSEPR)**: 3D shapes from electron domain repulsion
  - Electron domains include bonding and lone pairs
  - Lone pairs compress bond angles
  - Linear → Bent, Trigonal planar → Bent, Tetrahedral → Trigonal pyramidal → Bent
  - Polarity depends on geometry: symmetry cancels dipoles
- **Metallic Bonding**: Delocalized "sea of electrons"
  - Explains conductivity, malleability, luster
  - Band theory: conduction and valence bands
  - Semiconductors: small band gap
- **Intermolecular Forces** (IMFs): Forces between molecules
  1. **London dispersion**: Temporary dipoles (all molecules)
     - Strength increases with molecular size/surface area
     - Polarizability: ease of electron cloud distortion
  2. **Dipole-dipole**: Permanent dipoles align (polar molecules)
     - Stronger than dispersion for similar size
  3. **Hydrogen bonding**: H-F, H-O, H-N (strongest IMF)
     - Accounts for high boiling points of H₂O, NH₃, HF
     - Critical for DNA structure and protein folding
  4. **Ion-dipole**: Ions with polar molecules (e.g., NaCl in H₂O)
     - Strongest IMF, enables ionic compound dissolution

**Conceptual Insights**:
- Covalent bonding is quantum mechanical phenomenon (orbital overlap)
- Ionic and covalent are extremes of bonding continuum
- Electronegativity difference predicts bond character
- Resonance structures don't oscillate; molecule is hybrid
- Molecular shape determines properties (polarity, reactivity)
- IMFs determine physical properties (melting/boiling points, viscosity)

**Key Applications**: Drug design, materials engineering, polymer science, nanotechnology, catalysis, supramolecular chemistry

### 3. Stoichiometry
Quantitative relationships in chemistry:
- **Mole Concept**: Counting particles using Avogadro's number
- **Balancing Equations**: Mass conservation in reactions
- **Limiting Reactants**: Determining reaction yields
- **Percent Yield**: Measuring reaction efficiency

**Key Applications**: Manufacturing, quality control, pharmaceutical production, environmental analysis

### 4. States of Matter
Physical forms and phase transitions:
- **Solids**: Fixed structure and crystalline arrangements
- **Liquids**: Flowing matter with fixed volume
- **Gases**: Ideal and real gas laws
- **Phase Changes**: Energy in transitions

**Key Applications**: Materials processing, weather prediction, cryogenics, refrigeration

### 5. Thermochemistry
Energy changes in chemical reactions - chemistry is driven by energy. Thermodynamics determines what reactions occur:
- **Enthalpy (H)**: Heat content and reaction heat
  - State function (path-independent)
  - Exothermic: ΔH < 0 (releases heat, products more stable)
  - Endothermic: ΔH > 0 (absorbs heat, products less stable)
  - Standard enthalpy of formation ΔH°_f: from elements at standard state
  - Hess's law: enthalpy is additive (consequence of state function)
  - Bond enthalpies: energy to break bonds
  - ΔH_rxn = Σ(bonds broken) - Σ(bonds formed)
- **Entropy (S)**: Disorder and spontaneity
  - Measure of energy dispersal or disorder
  - S increases: solid → liquid → gas, dissolving, more particles
  - Second law: ΔS_universe > 0 for spontaneous processes
  - Third law: S = 0 at 0 K for perfect crystal
  - ΔS° = ΣS°(products) - ΣS°(reactants)
  - Molecular interpretation: number of accessible microstates
- **Gibbs Free Energy (G)**: Predicting spontaneous reactions
  - G = H - TS combines enthalpy and entropy
  - ΔG < 0: spontaneous (thermodynamically favorable)
  - ΔG > 0: non-spontaneous (requires energy input)
  - ΔG = 0: equilibrium (no net change)
  - Standard: ΔG° = ΔH° - TΔS°
  - ΔG° = -RT ln K (connects thermodynamics and equilibrium)
  - Non-standard: ΔG = ΔG° + RT ln Q
  - Temperature can change spontaneity sign
- **Calorimetry**: Measuring heat changes
  - q = mcΔT (constant pressure, specific heat)
  - Coffee cup calorimeter: constant P, measures ΔH
  - Bomb calorimeter: constant V, measures ΔU
  - ΔH = ΔU + PΔV (usually ΔH ≈ ΔU for condensed phases)

**Thermodynamic Principles**:
- First law: ΔU = q + w (energy conservation)
- Second law: entropy of universe increases
- Spontaneity depends on both ΔH and ΔS
- Four cases:
  1. ΔH < 0, ΔS > 0: always spontaneous
  2. ΔH > 0, ΔS < 0: never spontaneous
  3. ΔH < 0, ΔS < 0: spontaneous at low T
  4. ΔH > 0, ΔS > 0: spontaneous at high T
- Standard state: 1 bar, 25°C, 1 M for solutions

**Conceptual Insights**:
- Thermodynamics tells if reaction occurs, not how fast
- Exothermic reactions not always spontaneous (entropy matters)
- Life maintains low entropy locally by increasing entropy elsewhere
- Free energy is "useful work" available from reaction
- Coupling reactions: non-spontaneous driven by spontaneous

**Key Applications**: Energy storage, fuel efficiency, chemical manufacturing, climate science, biochemical reactions, battery design

### 6. Chemical Kinetics
Reaction rates and mechanisms - how fast reactions occur. Kinetics complements thermodynamics:
- **Reaction Rates**: How fast reactions occur
  - Rate = -Δ[reactant]/Δt = Δ[product]/Δt
  - Depends on: concentration, temperature, surface area, catalysts
  - Instantaneous vs average rate
  - Stoichiometry affects relative rates
- **Rate Laws**: Mathematical relationships
  - Rate = k[A]^m[B]^n (determined experimentally, not from equation)
  - k = rate constant (temperature dependent)
  - m, n = reaction orders (can be 0, 1, 2, or fractional)
  - Overall order = m + n
  - Units of k depend on overall order
- **Integrated Rate Laws**: Concentration vs time
  - Zero order: [A] = [A]₀ - kt; linear [A] vs t
  - First order: ln[A] = ln[A]₀ - kt; linear ln[A] vs t
  - Second order: 1/[A] = 1/[A]₀ + kt; linear 1/[A] vs t
  - Half-life depends on order and initial concentration (except 1st order)
- **Activation Energy (E_a)**: Energy barrier to reactions
  - Minimum energy for successful collision
  - Transition state (activated complex): highest energy along reaction path
  - Arrhenius equation: k = Ae^(-E_a/RT)
  - ln k vs 1/T gives straight line (slope = -E_a/R)
  - Higher T: more molecules exceed E_a (exponential increase in k)
  - Rule of thumb: rate doubles per 10°C increase
- **Reaction Mechanisms**: Step-by-step pathway
  - Elementary steps: single molecular event
  - Molecularity: number of molecules in elementary step (uni-, bi-, termolecular)
  - Rate-determining step: slowest step controls overall rate
  - Intermediates: produced then consumed (not in overall equation)
  - Mechanism must give overall equation when summed
  - Rate law derived from mechanism using fast equilibrium or steady-state approximation
- **Collision Theory**: Molecular basis of kinetics
  - Molecules must collide to react
  - Sufficient energy (> E_a) required
  - Proper orientation needed
  - Rate ∝ collision frequency × fraction with E > E_a × orientation factor
- **Catalysis**: Speeding reactions without consumption
  - Lowers activation energy E_a
  - Provides alternate mechanism with lower E_a
  - Homogeneous: same phase as reactants
  - Heterogeneous: different phase (surface reactions)
  - Enzymes: biological catalysts (highly specific)
  - Don't affect equilibrium position or ΔG (only rate)
  - Catalytic cycles: regenerated at end

**Conceptual Insights**:
- Thermodynamics: "will it go?"; Kinetics: "how fast?"
- Rate law must be determined experimentally
- Elementary steps follow rate law from stoichiometry
- Temperature affects rate exponentially (Arrhenius)
- Catalysts allow new pathway, don't change thermodynamics
- Enzyme specificity from precise active site geometry

**Key Applications**: Industrial production, enzyme function, drug development, pollution control, food preservation, polymer synthesis

### 7. Chemical Equilibrium
Dynamic balance in reversible reactions - forward and reverse rates equal. Most reactions reach equilibrium:
- **Equilibrium Constant (K)**: Quantifying equilibrium position
  - K_c = [products]/[reactants] with stoichiometric exponents
  - K_p = (P_products)/(P_reactants) for gases
  - K_p = K_c(RT)^Δn where Δn = Δ(moles of gas)
  - Pure solids and liquids omitted from K expression
  - Large K (>10³): products favored
  - Small K (<10⁻³): reactants favored
  - K changes only with temperature
  - K relates to ΔG°: ΔG° = -RT ln K
- **Reaction Quotient (Q)**: Non-equilibrium conditions
  - Same form as K but not at equilibrium
  - Q < K: forward reaction (produce more products)
  - Q > K: reverse reaction (produce more reactants)
  - Q = K: at equilibrium (no net change)
  - Predicts direction of shift
- **Le Châtelier's Principle**: System responds to oppose stress
  - Add reactant/remove product → shift right (more products)
  - Remove reactant/add product → shift left (more reactants)
  - Increase temperature: endothermic direction (treat heat as reactant/product)
  - Decrease temperature: exothermic direction
  - Increase pressure/decrease volume: fewer moles of gas side
  - Catalysts: no effect on equilibrium position (only rate to equilibrium)
  - Inert gas at constant V: no effect (partial pressures unchanged)
- **ICE Tables**: Systematic problem-solving tool
  - Initial concentrations
  - Change in concentrations (stoichiometry)
  - Equilibrium concentrations
  - Substitute into K expression
  - Small K approximation: x negligible if K < 10⁻³ and initial >> K
- **Solubility Equilibrium**: Precipitation reactions
  - K_sp = [cation]^m[anion]^n (solubility product)
  - Dissolution: solid ⇌ ions in solution
  - Q_sp < K_sp: unsaturated (more can dissolve)
  - Q_sp = K_sp: saturated (equilibrium)
  - Q_sp > K_sp: supersaturated (precipitates)
  - **Common ion effect**: reduces solubility
  - Complex ion formation increases solubility
  - pH affects solubility of salts with basic/acidic ions

**Equilibrium Principles**:
- Equilibrium is dynamic: forward and reverse rates equal, not stopped
- K is ratio of rate constants: K = k_forward/k_reverse
- Equilibrium reached from either direction gives same K
- Multiple equilibria: K_overall = K₁ × K₂ × ...
- Reverse reaction: K_reverse = 1/K_forward
- Temperature is only factor that changes K value

**Conceptual Insights**:
- Equilibrium doesn't mean equal concentrations
- Le Châtelier: system minimizes imposed stress
- Adding catalyst speeds both directions equally
- Pressure affects equilibrium only if Δn_gas ≠ 0
- Common ion effect from Le Châtelier principle

**Key Applications**: Industrial chemistry (Haber process), environmental chemistry, biochemical systems, buffer design, precipitation analysis

### 8. Acids and Bases
Proton transfer chemistry - fundamental to aqueous chemistry and biochemistry. Multiple theoretical frameworks:
- **Acid-Base Theories**: Evolution of concepts
  - **Arrhenius**: Acids produce H⁺, bases produce OH⁻ (aqueous only)
  - **Brønsted-Lowry**: Acids donate H⁺, bases accept H⁺ (general)
    - Conjugate pairs: acid ⇌ base + H⁺
    - Amphoteric: can act as acid or base (H₂O, HSO₄⁻)
  - **Lewis**: Acids accept electron pairs, bases donate electron pairs (most general)
    - Includes reactions without H⁺ (BF₃ + NH₃)
- **pH Scale**: Measuring acidity
  - pH = -log[H⁺], pOH = -log[OH⁻]
  - pH + pOH = 14 at 25°C (from K_w)
  - K_w = [H⁺][OH⁻] = 1.0 × 10⁻¹⁴ at 25°C (temperature dependent)
  - pH < 7: acidic; pH = 7: neutral; pH > 7: basic
  - Each pH unit = 10× change in [H⁺]
- **Acid-Base Strength**: K_a and K_b values
  - Strong acids: completely dissociate (HCl, HNO₃, H₂SO₄, HClO₄)
  - Weak acids: partially dissociate (CH₃COOH, HF)
  - K_a = [H⁺][A⁻]/[HA] (acid dissociation constant)
  - Strong bases: Group 1 and 2 hydroxides
  - Weak bases: partially accept H⁺ (NH₃, amines)
  - K_b = [OH⁻][BH⁺]/[B] (base dissociation constant)
  - Conjugate pair: K_a × K_b = K_w
  - Larger K_a = stronger acid; Larger K_b = stronger base
  - pK_a = -log K_a (convenient for weak acids)
  - Percent ionization = ([H⁺]_eq/[HA]₀) × 100%
- **Polyprotic Acids**: Multiple ionizable protons
  - H₂SO₄, H₃PO₄, H₂CO₃
  - K_a1 >> K_a2 >> K_a3 (stepwise ionization)
  - pH calculations dominated by first ionization
- **Buffer Solutions**: Resisting pH changes
  - Weak acid + conjugate base (or weak base + conjugate acid)
  - **Henderson-Hasselbalch**: pH = pK_a + log([A⁻]/[HA])
  - Maximum buffer capacity at pH = pK_a (equal concentrations)
  - Buffer range: pH = pK_a ± 1
  - Buffers resist pH change by neutralizing added acid/base
  - Blood buffer: H₂CO₃/HCO₃⁻ (pH ≈ 7.4)
  - Buffer capacity depends on concentration and ratio
- **Titrations**: Analytical technique
  - Add titrant to analyte until stoichiometric equivalence
  - **Equivalence point**: moles acid = moles base
  - **Endpoint**: indicator color change (should match equivalence)
  - Strong acid + strong base: pH = 7 at equivalence
  - Weak acid + strong base: pH > 7 (conjugate base present)
  - Strong acid + weak base: pH < 7 (conjugate acid present)
  - Weak acid + weak base: pH depends on K_a and K_b
  - Titration curve: pH vs volume added
  - Buffer region: before equivalence point (weak acid/base)
  - Choose indicator with pK_in near equivalence point pH

**Acid-Base Principles**:
- Water autoionizes: 2H₂O ⇌ H₃O⁺ + OH⁻
- Stronger acid has weaker conjugate base
- Leveling effect: strong acids appear equally strong in water
- Salt hydrolysis affects pH (cation/anion from weak acid/base)
- Buffer works by common ion effect

**Conceptual Insights**:
- pH scale is logarithmic (exponential [H⁺] differences)
- Weak acids in equilibrium: use ICE table and K_a
- Buffers most effective when pH ≈ pK_a (equal weak acid and conjugate base)
- Titration curve shape reveals acid/base strength
- Biological systems require precise pH control (enzyme function)

**Key Applications**: Medicine, biology, environmental science, food chemistry, industrial processes, analytical chemistry, pharmaceutical formulation

### 9. Redox Reactions
Electron transfer processes - energy conversion between chemical and electrical. Oxidation and reduction always coupled:
- **Oxidation States (O.N.)**: Tracking electron transfer
  - Rules: free element = 0, monatomic ion = charge, H = +1 (usually), O = -2 (usually), Group 1 = +1, Group 2 = +2
  - Sum of O.N. = charge of species
  - **Oxidation**: loss of electrons (O.N. increases)
  - **Reduction**: gain of electrons (O.N. decreases)
  - Mnemonic: **OIL RIG** (Oxidation Is Loss, Reduction Is Gain)
  - Or: **LEO GER** (Lose Electrons Oxidation, Gain Electrons Reduction)
- **Balancing Redox**: Half-reaction method
  1. Separate oxidation and reduction half-reactions
  2. Balance atoms except O and H
  3. Balance O by adding H₂O
  4. Balance H by adding H⁺ (acidic) or OH⁻ (basic)

  - E°_cell = E°_cathode - E°_anode
  - E°_cell > 0: spontaneous (galvanic)
  - E°_cell < 0: non-spontaneous (electrolytic)
  - Relationship to free energy: ΔG° = -nFE°_cell
    - n = moles of electrons transferred
    - F = Faraday constant = 96,485 C/mol
  - At equilibrium: E_cell = 0, ΔG = 0
  - E°_cell = (RT/nF) ln K = (0.0592/n) log K at 25°C
- **Nernst Equation**: Non-standard conditions
  - E_cell = E°_cell - (RT/nF) ln Q
  - E_cell = E°_cell - (0.0592/n) log Q at 25°C
  - Q = reaction quotient
  - As cell operates: Q increases, E_cell decreases
  - At equilibrium: Q = K, E_cell = 0
- **Practical Electrochemistry**:
  - **Batteries**: Galvanic cells
    - Primary: single use (alkaline, zinc-carbon)
    - Secondary: rechargeable (lead-acid, lithium-ion)
  - **Fuel cells**: Continuous reactant supply (H₂/O₂)

    - Prevention: coating, cathodic protection, alloying
  - **Electrolysis**: Decompose compounds
    - Water: 2H₂O → 2H₂ + O₂
    - Aluminum production: Al₂O₃ → Al
  - **Electroplating**: Deposit metal coating

**Redox Principles**:
- Oxidation and reduction always occur together
- Electrons cannot exist free in solution
- Spontaneous: electrons flow from lower to higher E°
- Intensive property: E° doesn't change with amount
- Electrochemistry links thermodynamics (ΔG) and electricity (E)

**Conceptual Insights**:
- Redox is electron transfer (acid-base is proton transfer)
- Half-reactions are conceptual; both occur simultaneously
- Standard potentials predict spontaneity under standard conditions
- Batteries convert chemical potential energy to electrical work
