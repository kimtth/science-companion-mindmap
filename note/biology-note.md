### 3. Evolution
The unifying principle of biology - descent with modification. Evolution explains both unity and diversity of life:
- **Natural Selection**: Darwin's mechanism of adaptive evolution
  - **Observations**:
    1. Overproduction: More offspring than can survive
    2. Variation: Individuals differ in traits
    3. Heritability: Traits passed to offspring
  - **Inferences**:
    1. Differential survival and reproduction (fitness)
    2. Accumulation of favorable traits over generations
  - Result: Population evolves (allele frequencies change)
  - Individuals don't evolve; populations evolve
  - Natural selection acts on phenotypes, but evolution is change in alleles
- **Types of Natural Selection**:
  - **Directional**: Favors one extreme (giraffes' necks, antibiotic resistance)
  - **Stabilizing**: Favors intermediate (human birth weight)
  - **Disruptive**: Favors both extremes (beak sizes in variable food supply)
  - **Sexual selection**: Traits increase mating success (peacock tails)
    - Intrasexual: competition within sex
    - Intersexual: mate choice
  - **Balancing selection**: Maintains variation (heterozygote advantage)
- **Evidence for Evolution**: Multiple independent lines of evidence
  1. **Fossil record**: Documents history of life
     - Transitional forms (Tiktaalik: fish → tetrapod)
     - Succession of forms over time
     - Mass extinctions and radiations
  2. **Comparative anatomy**:
     - **Homologous structures**: Same origin, different function (mammalian forelimbs)
       - Evidence of common ancestry
     - **Analogous structures**: Different origin, same function (bird/insect wings)
       - Evidence of convergent evolution
     - **Vestigial structures**: Reduced/non-functional remnants (human appendix, whale pelvis)
  3. **Comparative embryology**: Similar developmental stages (pharyngeal pouches)
  4. **Molecular biology**: DNA/protein similarities
     - More similar sequences = more recent common ancestor
     - Molecular clocks: neutral mutations accumulate at constant rate
     - Pseudogenes and shared mistakes
  5. **Biogeography**: Species distribution patterns
     - Island species similar to mainland (Galápagos finches)
     - Continental drift explains distributions
  6. **Direct observation**: Evolution in action
     - Antibiotic resistance in bacteria
     - Peppered moth color shift
     - HIV evolution in patients
     - Experimental evolution in laboratories
- **Speciation**: Formation of new species
  - **Species concept**: Biological species can interbreed and produce fertile offspring
    - Other concepts: morphological, ecological, phylogenetic
  - **Reproductive isolation**: Barriers to gene flow
    - **Prezygotic** (before fertilization):
      - Habitat isolation, temporal isolation, behavioral isolation
      - Mechanical isolation, gametic isolation
    - **Postzygotic** (after fertilization):
      - Reduced hybrid viability, reduced hybrid fertility, hybrid breakdown
  - **Allopatric speciation**: Geographic isolation
    - Population separated by barrier
    - Different selection pressures or genetic drift
    - Most common mode
  - **Sympatric speciation**: No geographic barrier
    - Polyploidy (especially in plants): chromosome doubling
    - Sexual selection, habitat specialization
  - Rate: gradualism (slow, steady) vs punctuated equilibrium (rapid bursts)
- **Population Genetics**: Allele frequencies in populations
  - **Hardy-Weinberg Equilibrium**: No evolution baseline
    - Allele frequencies: p + q = 1
    - Genotype frequencies: p² + 2pq + q² = 1
    - **Conditions** (if met, no evolution):
      1. No mutations
      2. Random mating
      3. No natural selection
      4. No gene flow (migration)
      5. Large population (no genetic drift)
    - Use: detect if evolution occurring by comparing observed to expected
  - **Genetic drift**: Random changes in allele frequencies
    - **Bottleneck effect**: Population size drastically reduced
    - **Founder effect**: Small group colonizes new area
    - Stronger effect in small populations
    - Can fix deleterious alleles or lose beneficial alleles
  - **Gene flow**: Allele movement between populations (migration)
    - Homogenizes populations, opposes speciation
    - Introduces new alleles
  - **Mutation**: Ultimate source of new alleles
    - Provides raw material for evolution
    - Usually neutral or deleterious, rarely beneficial
  - **Non-random mating**: Affects genotype (not allele) frequencies
    - Inbreeding: increases homozygosity
    - Sexual selection: non-random mate choice
- **Macroevolution**: Large-scale evolutionary changes
  - Origin of new taxonomic groups
  - Evolutionary trends
  - **Adaptive radiation**: Rapid diversification (mammals after dinosaurs)
  - **Convergent evolution**: Similar environments → similar traits
  - **Coevolution**: Reciprocal evolutionary changes (flowers and pollinators)
  - **Extinction**: 99% of species that ever lived are extinct

**Evolutionary Principles**:
- Evolution is change in allele frequencies over time
- Natural selection is non-random survival and reproduction
- Evolution is not goal-directed or progressive
- Organisms don't evolve during their lifetime (acquired traits not inherited)
- Evolution is both fact (descent with modification occurred) and theory (mechanisms)

**Conceptual Insights**:
- Fitness is reproductive success, not strength
- Adaptations are traits that increase fitness in specific environment
- Evolution can only modify existing structures (constraints)
- Trade-offs: no perfect organism (pleiotropy, genetic correlations)
- Common ancestry explains both similarities and differences among species
- Microevolution (within species) + time = macroevolution (new species)

**Key Applications**: Medicine (antibiotic resistance, vaccine design), agriculture (crop improvement, pest management), conservation (preserving genetic diversity), understanding disease origins

### 4. Ecology
Interactions between organisms and their environment - study of distribution and abundance. Ecology operates at multiple levels:

      - Doubling time: t_d = 0.693/r
    - **Logistic growth**: dN/dt = r_max × N × (K-N)/K (S-shaped curve)
      - K = carrying capacity (maximum sustainable population)
      - Growth slows as N approaches K
      - More realistic than exponential
  - **Limiting factors**:

    - **Trophic levels**: Producers → primary consumers → secondary consumers → tertiary consumers
    - **10% rule**: ~10% energy transferred to next level
      - Most lost as heat (2nd law of thermodynamics)
    - **Biomass pyramid**: Usually decreases at higher levels
      - Exceptions: inverted in some aquatic (phytoplankton reproduce rapidly)

    - Factors limiting: light, water, nutrients, temperature
    - Highest: tropical rainforests, estuaries, coral reefs
  - **Nutrient Cycling**: Matter recycled (unlike energy)
    - **Carbon cycle**:
      - Photosynthesis removes CO₂, respiration releases CO₂
      - Fossil fuel burning adds CO₂ (anthropogenic)
      - Ocean and forest carbon sinks
    - **Nitrogen cycle**:
